Hi! This website is where I keep track of the things I've made.

In the real world, I'm a PhD student in [Neural Computation](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/pnc) and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm interested in using techniques from statistics and machine learning to figure out how populations of neurons interact to cause behavior. My advisors are [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/) and [Steve Chase](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~schase/index.php).

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/JayHennig-CV.pdf). Even better, send me an email at <img src="/assets/images/email.png" style="width: 25%;"/>, or find me on twitter [@jehosafet](https://twitter.com/jehosafet).
