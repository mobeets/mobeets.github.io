_(via Mitch Hedberg's joke about broken escalators: "Sorry, escalator temporarily stairs.")_

* Things that, when broken, are the same only shorter/smaller:
    * pencil => shorter pencil
    * stick => shorter stick
    * ruler => shorter ruler
    * rock => smaller rocks

* Things that, when broken, become insulated boxes:
    * oven => insulated box
    * refrigerator => insulated box
    * microwave => insulated box

* Things that, when broken, still maintain a subset of their original functions:
    * escalator => stairs
    * moving sidewalk => ground
    * electric toothbrush => heavy toothbrush
    * electric bicycle => heavy bicycle
    * electric fence => fence
    * quantum computer => classical computer
    * iPhone (with broken cellular contract) => iPod Touch
    * headphones => earmuffs
    * speech => stuttering

* Things that, because of being broken, become something new:
    * government => environmental theater production
    * ceiling => skylight
    * skin => scab
