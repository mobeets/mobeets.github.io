<a href="https://twitter.com/FOMOBot" target="_blank">@FOMOBot</a> is a twitter bot who doesn't want to miss a thing.
<br><br>
Once an hour, @FOMOBot checks his twitter, looking for tweets coming from his favorite places. When he finds one--feeling left out, forgotten, and uninvited--he consoles himself by browsing Instagram and Flickr for photos from that same location. He'll let you know what he finds. (Note: Living in constant fear of missing out, @FOMOBot tends to be a bit of a guilt-tripper.)
<br><br>
From November 17 - 24, 2013, @FOMOBot tweeted directly at users--and then Twitter suspended his account. He's back now, having learned a valuable lesson: If you're going to tweet at strangers, <a href="http://blog.jehosafet.com/2013/12/fomobot-post-mortem.html" target="_blank">be pleasant</a>.
<br><br>
@FOMOBot was begun on August 6, 2013 and released on August 12, 2013. His <a href="https://github.com/mobeets/FOMOBot" target="_blank">existence</a> was inspired by the twitter bots created by <a href="http://www.tinysubversions.com" target="_blank">tiny subversions</a>.
