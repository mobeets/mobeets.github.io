            <p>Being my girlfriend, Jess was the obvious choice for a first interview in a series exploring discontent. The claim that Jess is an "obvious choice" for a series on discontent may sound rude, but this ridiculous blanket statement is a great example of why I think being unfulfilled is such a funny theme: Everyone is surely unfulfilled to some extent, but when the theme of an interview is negative, who would possibly want to volunteer to be your subject? The only obvious choices, as a result, are your friends.</p>
            <p>Having known Jess for five years now, I've seen her move very regularly from one interest to the next, much to the confusion of everyone around her. She's gone from being a cultural anthropology major, to studying primate brain evolution in a primatology lab, to playing keyboards in a band, to social networking for an HR startup, to assistant editor at an arts and culture magazine, and now, most recently, to seeking a job as a social worker. She says she's just trying on different hats in an endless game called the process of career elimination. Ultimately, she claims, her goal is to promote a general awareness of and respect for different cultural perspectives. But perhaps more unique is the fact that she (at least subconsciously) does not consider herself a primate.</p>

                <b>JESS:</b> Well, it kinda is. I'm always tempted to grow it out, to see how far I can go, just because I never have, and it seems like something I should do at least once in my life.

                <b>JESS:</b> Job to job? I kinda think I don't have a good system. My system is...If I'm bored&mdash;or no, if I'm unhappy. That's my major barometer for whether I should keep doing it or not.

                <b>JEH:</b> That doesn't sound like such a bad strategy.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah, I guess it's not. But it doesn't feel like a strategy because there's nothing concrete about it. But I guess when you say it nicely like "Follow your bliss" it sounds a little bit better.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> You're saying it's all intuitive&mdash;it's not like you have some kind of secret mathematical metric for when you decide to move on, it's just kind of...
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> It almost is kinda secret. It's secret to me. Sometimes I just feel kinda like I feel like shit and everything sucks and then I think...Maybe I should change that. And then I just quit or something.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> And how do the people around you affect that secret? Like the guys saying "Ew, you gross girl with armpit hair." Do you feel like you're affected by other people's perceptions of what you're going after?

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Um, yeah. I've got a lot of voices in my head, I think, when it comes to making decisions. Like, I hear my mom, I hear my dad, I hear you...And sometimes I don't think that those are helpful. [laughs] I kinda think that they're not helpful, because then I just end up doubting my own gut feelings. And then on the other hand I hear my mom saying "Follow your gut" and at the same time I hear other people saying "Maybe you're overreacting" and then I just don't know what to do and I'm paralyzed by the decision.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> So to make sure, you go by feelings and voices.

                <b>JEH:</b> What about other gut-oriented things? Like, how does food play into satisfaction?

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> I eat badly when I'm unhappy.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Do you use food as a reward, or as a punishment?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> It's almost a reward and a punishment at the same time.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> I was reading in the...in [Pressfield's] <i>The War of Art</i>, that, there was this page I had bookmarked, because it was really funny.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Oh, is that the writer guy?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Yeah, it says, um...Ah, shit. Maybe I lost it. It was something about...Oh, here we go. "Sometimes The Resistance takes the form of sex, or an obsessive preoccupation with sex. Why sex? Because sex provides immediate and powerful gratification...We feel validated and approved of, even loved...Resistance gets a big kick out of that. It knows that it has distracted us with a cheap and easy fix and prevented us from doing our work. It goes without saying that this principle also applies to drugs, shopping, masturbation, TV, gossip, alcohol, and the consumption of all products containing fat, sugar, and salt." [laughs] I thought that was pretty good.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yes, that is true, that's true.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> But it's interesting how whenever you're wanting any kind of gratification you've got lots you can go to. But how do you find&mdash;do you feel like you have any sort of system for obtaining a more long-term satisfaction? Like, looking back at the end of something and saying "Yeah, I got that. I'm satisfied."
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Personally? No. And I think that that's kinda something that I&mdash;that's&mdash;I think I will be a more fulfilled person if I do that. I don't feel like I've got good tools to look back and appreciate and...get something from the past. I've never denied myself anything that I want&mdash;pretty much. And that's a huge part of it I think.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> So you think denial is a big part of satisfaction? Of long-term satisfaction?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah, that's why I was saying when I'm eating badly it's like a punishment and a reward because I feel like...like when I'm eating a bunch of cookies, all I'm thinking is bad thoughts about myself. I'm not thinking anything good. You know? There are moments when I say [high-pitched, patronizing voice:] "You worked out really good today&mdash;here's a cookie. Good job. Cookie time." But usually when I'm eating food that's bad for me it's like [growling, demonic voice:] "You suck. Eat this cookie. You suck you know you want this cookie." That's because I know that I give into my gratification a little bit too much. But I don't know&mdash;like, how do you enjoy a cookie properly? In the metaphorical sense. How does one enjoy something and get the most out of it? That question really bothers me.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> I think by making lots of noises and grunting.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> [snarls and eats make-believe cookie, laughs] But that question really bothers me. Like, how do you enjoy something?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> How does it feel, or...?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah. I feel like I've denied myself cookies&mdash;metaphorical cookies&mdash;and then had them, and appreciated them. And then I've had them steadily, like a constant flow of cookies, and enjoyed those too. But none of those times have I ever felt a sort of transcendent feeling, like, "Wow, finally." I don't think I've ever had that feeling.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Where you're just sitting around day after day thinking "Yeah, this is good."
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Never?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Never. [pauses] Well, maybe I've got a wrong idea of what it's supposed to be.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> I guess if you don't have a name for that feeling in your life then you could have it and not know that that's what it is?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Do you ever get on the internet and do the same sort of reward/punishment thing we were talking about with cookies?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah.

                <b>JEH:</b> What do you do?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Buzzfeed. And tumblr.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> What is it about those things? Are they funny to you, or...?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Funny. No thought necessary. Just pure consumption.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Infinite scrolling.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> It's the [snarling cookie noises]. It's the scarfing down of information and funniness.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Maybe they'd be even more effective if they made those sites more like cookies, like you could scroll for a few seconds, but then there'd be this tiny little pause&mdash;the act of grabbing the next cookie&mdash;because I know when I'm scarfing down cookies I like to completely finish a cookie and try to sit there for like five seconds before I go for the next cookie.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> I guess grabbing the next cookie is just clicking the next link though. Same thing. Anyway, what do you like about Buzzfeed?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> I...just like GIFs. And Buzzfeed's full of the GIFs. I get a lot of entertainment out of that. It's pure entertainment. But the more you spend on Buzzfeed, the worst it gets. It's all the same. And then before you know it, you're not laughing anymore. You're just scrolling through bullshit and you're not even having fun anymore.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Do you feel any kind of habitual interest in learning about successful people? Like for myself I kinda get off on reading the little author biographies in the fronts of books. "Born in Oxford in 1896. By the age of thirteen he was chopping lumber with his father, and after a devastating accident with an axe...He soon became the first male nurse." Does that motivate you at all?
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> In the past I haven't had much of an interest in things like that. But recently I have, and I think that's because I've been trying to take "success" seriously. And what "success" means. When I started reading Jessica Valenti's book, the feminist book...That's kinda how I found out about social work, through that book. And reading about other people's lives and seeing how people can become figureheads of a movement...And I just kinda thought "Oh, that's a pretty cool starting place I guess: Social work." But it wasn't like I was searching it out as a model for success.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Do you think maybe a lack of appropriate role models contributes to that lack of interest in success? Most success stories seem to be about men.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yes, totally. I 100% agree with that. Because the successful females are musicians or actresses.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> I was thinking about how yesterday when we were listening to Feist in the car, and then Fiona Apple, and I didn't even notice the transition. I didn't notice when the songs changed.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Most girl rock bands kinda have a similar energy level. And then you have Courtney Love's Hole on the other side, but...If I were just a normal girl I would probably just get to see girl role models playing that one particular type of music. Maybe we need some affirmative action or something for girls to play more intense music or something.
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Yeah, it's pretty annoying. It sucks that I only had Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson to look up to as a kid. I mean, that would've completely changed my idea of what girls were supposed to be like. It comes back to the armpit hair thing. Women in the media are portrayed in a very specific way, and it's not about success in an intellectual way. It makes it difficult to plan success for yourself.

That's probably been the most "successful" thing in the typical sense that you've been involved in&mdash;correct me if I'm wrong. And then you stopped that.

                <b>JESS:</b> I think I had a more realistic idea of who I was after I quit. And the thing that kinda irked me about being in the band is that I knew I wasn't really a musician. And that I was being looked at as if I was a musician, and people would contact me and ask me to play with them, but I didn't actually feel like I had the skills to do that, you know what I mean? I didn't like the feeling of "I'm this one person, a musician" versus who I really felt like. That was a big thing.

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> It seems like some amount of external acceptance can kind of plant you deeper into a role. Another thing the guy in <i>The War of Art</i> was saying is that "the amateur over-identifies with his craft", whereas the professional...Or wait, maybe that's not what I'm saying at all. I was thinking more like the process of getting recognized almost makes you feel more like&mdash;

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> Like "Oh I am a this." Yeah, but I think maybe you're both right. For me, when I was playing in The Eastern Sea&mdash;

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Wait, I don't think I even know what I'm saying. Can you explain to me what I'm saying versus what he's saying, just so I make sure I...?

            <div id="statement">
                <b>JESS:</b> [laughs] Yeah, so he's saying amateurs only identify with the identity they're pursuing. So when you start playing music you say "I'm a musician. I do this," and you have that whole identity. And you're saying&mdash;
            </div>
            <div id="statement">
                <b>JEH:</b> Right, and then I was trying to say that when you first start getting accepted in a role that it's then you might finally feel validated. I wouldn't feel like I was a musician until someone else accepted me and said "You're a musician."

Like, yesterday I watched a bunch of video blogs on youTube about African-American women and the "natural hair community". Apparently there is this whole language about what constitutes "natural" hair and what doesn't, and the idea that, culturally, you can have "bad" hair...The fact that it can be a rebellion to have natural hair, I think that's a really cool idea, that it's something that can be so tied to one's personal identity.

It's just the sincerity, and the attempts to really express something that's dear to you. Like "I want the world to know that when vaginas are menstruating, this is what it's like...I'm not going to plug it up, or whatever, just because it makes you feel uncomfortable." The idea that people have to try to make the rest of the world feel comfortable for something that is natural to them. I just really like when someone can unashamedly say "Fuck that, this is how I naturally am, I'm not going to try to not make you feel uncomfortable," you know? Like, Questlove's article after the Trayvon Martin case. People can feel compelled to feel responsible for something that's not their fault. I just think it's great when someone recognizes that and stands up against it.

                <b>JESS:</b> But it's still important to try to understand someone else's perspective. To be a silent ally, to understand their perspective but also know that I don't necessarily have the right to talk about it or to participate. It makes me a more conscious person, and I think it's important to notice when subconscious, unintentional stuff leaks through. Because I wouldn't be able to consider myself "an ally" if I didn't speak up when I thought I saw something that is inappropriate. I read this blog post of "101 things guys can do to be allies to women," and it was just like "Don't laugh when a friend says a sexist joke, or, tell your friend it was a sexist joke." It wasn't that you have to be active in the community&mdash;just that you don't maintain the status quo. And I feel like, if I understand someone's perspective I can do better than maintain the status quo without necessarily having to be "involved" in the community.

I just want to kinda understand the cultural forces at play, and then, ideally, I would like to go back to writing and just sorta try to bring all those perspectives together and just put them out there, you know?
