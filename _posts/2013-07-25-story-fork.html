<a href="/story-fork" target="_blank">Story fork</a> allows users to build non-linear conversations with tweets.
<br><br>
Story fork was conceived as a platform for writing collaborative branching stories via twitter, but it can also be used as a scaffolding for twitter-based discussions, given that twitter's support for "conversations" is extremely limited.
<br><br>
From a more technical perspective, story fork displays tweets as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)" target="_blank">trees</a> using the javascript library <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">d3</a>.
