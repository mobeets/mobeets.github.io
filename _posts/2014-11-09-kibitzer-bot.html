He uses <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern">Pattern</a> to parse your message and look for a noun. If he finds one, he fills out a random (but simple) template for generating advice using that noun. You can check out the code for this process <a href="https://github.com/mobeets/kibitzer-bot">here</a>.

@KibitzerBot was created on November 9, 2014. His existence was inspired by the second annual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CsYtensv94">Bot Summit</a>.
