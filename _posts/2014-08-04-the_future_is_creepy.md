### A thought experiment
Pretend you grew up in Texas, and that after you graduated college you moved to a new country: Australia. Also, you're a girl, and your last name is Gauthier.

You're scrolling through facebook one day when you see an ad for perfume.

"Oh," you don't even bother saying because of how unsurprising this perfume ad is, "facebook knows I'm a girl, so they think I must like perfume."

You keep scrolling, and then another ad comes up:

![gauther-ad](/images/gauthier.png)

"Weird," you now say. It's not _too_ weird, but just slightly weird because you didn't think Gauthier was that common of a name. It's at least mildly surprising that there'd be enough Gauthiers in the world interested in buying t-shirts with their last names on them. You're not one of them, however, and you keep scrolling.

"Holy shit," you now say, because you _are_ a Texan living in Australia, and there can't be too many of those. "This is weird."


### The future is creepy

So how did it know? ("It" being whatever apparent evil, futuristic machine targeted you with such an ad.) I mean, it's easy enough to piece together, because your facebook profile mentions you having lived in both Texas and Australia. Still, there's something creepy about this ad even compared to the others.

You share the creepy ad. And your friends respond:

* "I wonder what their sales are like?"
* "You should change your privacy settings."
* "The future is creepy."

I like all of these reactions, but it's this last reaction that interests me the most: "The future is creepy."

People love being creeped out by the future, by robots, by the Internet. Because it's fun! But sometimes it's also fun to figure out _why_ something is so creepy. Sometimes things are actually creepier the more you question them.

### The smartest bots are actually just humans

When I saw that Australian Texan ad in my friend Kate's news feed, I was amused. "Huh!" I said. "Creepy."

I thought, okay, these t-shirts don't exist--they must auto-generate the shirt designs or something, and then they (already the "they" had become imaginary bots, surfing the web for human prey at high-bandwidth speed) scan the facebook graph for people in their twenties who've recently moved to a new country. They show them the ad, the people love it. Simple--but brilliant.

But it turns out that Teespring, the host of this "Australian Texan" t-shirt, is really a platform for regular old human sellers, using targeted ad campaigns to sell their yet-to-be-actually-made t-shirt designs. While automating the t-shirt design itself is surely an option, Teespring's ad campaigns seem to be created by people--people like this guy:

In [this post](http://teespringexpert.com/target-last-name-using-custom-audience-facebook/), Alex shows us how to use something called the "FB GRAPH SCRAPER" to show an ad to all the facebook users who fit the target demographic for the shirt he designed: those gorgeous black Gauthier tees shown above. Surely a similar process was used to target my friend Kate, the Australian Texan.[^1]

[^1]: If this "FB GRAPH SCRAPER" is surprising to you, you should play around with [this](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).

So, it turns out, Alex Fortun is pretty clever. But he's not a bot (I don't think), and he's not even trying to act like one: He's just trying to sell some t-shirts. So why are ads like his so creepy?

### One more thought experiment

Imagine you're Kate again. Only now, instead of scrolling through your news feed, you're sitting in your parents' living room in Texas. People keep knocking at your door and delivering you presents. You've never seen them before in your life. How creepy!

The first stranger pulls out a bottle of perfume. Makes sense: You're a girl, he can see that, so he figured you might like perfurme. And the next stranger brings you one of those Gauthier t-shirts. You feel a bit weird at first, but decide this stranger must know your last name since your family's address is still listed in the phone book. (The shirt's not in your size, but how could she have known?)

Finally, the last stranger comes. And he brings you that Australian Texan t-shirt. Now _that_ is creepy. Why? Because this is just some random stranger! How the hell did he know you'd been living in Australia?

### Where's the creepy?

All I'm saying is, it's not the ad on facebook that's creepy, it's the fact that someone like Alex Fortun, someone you've never met, is targeting you online using all that facebook data on your profile that you keep forgetting is there, and he's trying to make money off your sentiments. He achieves this targeting completely anonymously--anonymous on his end as well, perhaps, at least until you buy the shirt--and without any awkwardness.

What's creepy about this? It's the same thing that's brilliant about the ad idea: People tend to self-identify with their demographic when it's rare enough.[^2] So if someone knows certain facts, attainable on the Internet or not, they know a good part of what makes you who you are. The fact that Teespring lets you design and sell shirts without those shirts actually existing, and that facebook will sell you ad space targeted at particular types of people, these powers together allow you to automate intimate contact with complete strangers. Better still, most of these strangers tend to dismiss your creepy contact by attributing it to vague phrases like "the system", "the future," or, as I did, to "bots".

[^2]: I speak at least for myself, being another Texan who lived in Australia.

Even if they didn't turn out to be bots in the case of Teespring, surely someone will eventually figure out how to auto-generate t-shirt designs and sell them to people, and the resulting bots will put Alex Fortun out of business. [^3] So is that the truly creepy future? Where robots eventually supplant us and creep us so good that we're left with nothing to do but ogle their personalized t-shirt designs?

[^3]: Obligatory [Darius Kazemi](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions/darius-kazemi-s-bots/members) reference, because this guy's twitter bots are amazing, though not usually creepy.

No: That is not the creepy future. The truly creepy future is a world in which A.I. continues to advance and we continue to attribute its successes to mythical beings called "bots".

Even in cases when something actually _is_ automated, I think it makes more sense to know that there's still just a regular old human behind it, perhaps even a person trying to make money off of you. Because bots are just people. They're designed by people, run by people...They're just the tools of well-disguised people with effectively broad social skills. And talking to too many strangers is creepy. Right? Yeah, it's creepy. And I don't think it's very fair to blame it on the robots.
