## Demo

<video controls="controls" width="100%" height="100%" name="Loop Baby demo">

</video>

Just to explain what's going on in the video above, I have my phone's output fed into the looper's audio in, and the looper's output is connected to my (shitty) speakers. I then record three different samples from the music playing on my phone. The two piano samples are from the song "Glass Eyes", and the drum sample is from "Identikit," both of which are songs on Radiohead's _A Moon Shaped Pool_ (2016).

For some reason I had the pass-thru audio disabled, so you can only hear what the looper is playing---in other words, I was just blindly sampling audio. Still, the samples ended up sounding nice together.

## Functions

Here's what the buttons do, working from the bottom up:

- _Play_: Plays/pauses all playback
- _Rec/Add_: Recording/overdubbing mode
- _Un/Redo_: Undoes/redoes whatever you just did
- _Mute/Del_: For muting or deleting samples
- _Once_: Once-off mode (plays samples once instead of looping)
- _Bank_: For saving/recalling recorded samples to/from disk
- _Set_: For modifying other mysterious settings I've since forgotten
- _Gain_: For setting the input gain when recording
- _1-8_: Each button corresponds to a different track; in record mode, pressing will start/stop recording to that track; in playback mode, pressing toggles the track on/off

When a MIDI-USB cable is connected to something providing a clock signal, recording and playback is quantized to the nearest beat. This was, for me, the killer function that I couldn't find in a multi-track looper for less than like $500.

Unfortunately, the pandemic happened before I had a chance to figure out how to etch the button names on the board, so you have to just remember what all 16 buttons do. ðŸ™„

## Software

## Enclosure design

My design for the enclosure basically just combined two different designs I found: [One](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-box?view=all) for a Raspberry Pi enclosure, and a [second](https://learn.adafruit.com/trellis-3d-printed-enclosure?view=all) for the Trellis button matrix. My final design file, which I made in Illustrator, can be found [here](https://github.com/mobeets/loop-baby/blob/master/static/photos/design.ai).

The enclosure was cut out using a laser cutter I had access to at [CMU's IDeATe](https://ideate.cmu.edu/resources/guides/laser-cutters/index.html), and then assembled mostly by snapping the pieces together. (The exception---and the worst part of the design---is that the NeoTrellis attaches to the enclosure using some extremely tiny/finicky screws.)
