## Enclosure design

The enclosure was designed using Illustrator. I basically just combined two different designs I found: [One](https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-box?view=all) for a Raspberry Pi enclosure, and a [second](https://learn.adafruit.com/trellis-3d-printed-enclosure?view=all) for the Trellis button matrix. My design file can be found [here](https://github.com/mobeets/loop-baby/blob/master/static/photos/design.ai).

The enclosure was cut out using a laser cutter I had access to at [CMU's IDeATe](https://ideate.cmu.edu/resources/guides/laser-cutters/index.html). Unfortunately, the pandemic happened before I had a chance to figure out how to etch the button names on the board, so you have to just remember what all 16 buttons do. ðŸ™„
