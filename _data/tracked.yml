    description: 'pretty good (but sad) ending: 800 pages of loose ends to tie up,
        and it was done in a very depressing, fatalistic sort of way. I am happy to
        be done, but the book ended in a thoughtful way, which is strange because
        the whole rest of the book was entirely not thought-provoking.'
