                <i>A pneumatic animatronic animal band plays all your favorite songs.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                But honestly, words are not at all needed to describe why this is one of my favorite things in the world. The band is so creepy and amazing that nothing I can say to you in this paragraph will capture that better than the videos themselves. This is my <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2013/8174">super bomb</a>, and my only real recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The band was created by Aaron Fechter (who is apparently the inventor of Whac-a-Mole) and is recognizable as the creepy robot animal band that plays at Chuck E. Cheese. Fechter started programming the Rock-afire to perform modern songs on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/therockafire/videos">his youTube channel</a>, and later attempted to keep the (brilliant, unbelievable, inspirational) project going by allowing users to <a href="http://www.starsof.com/fans/page5.html">bid on the songs</a> they wanted to see the Rock-afire perform. If you're looking for something equally disturbing but not quite as entertaining, I also suggest the educational <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Lw4sYMAT4">videos</a> of his <a href="http://www.aaronskit.com/">Animatronic Experimenter's Kit</a>.

                Sergio Leone&mdash;I'm sure others can explain this better. Or you could just watch it if you haven't already. In my experience it was the kind of movie that only made me more curious as I read about it afterwards.

            <p>
                I have not sincerely committed myself to a TV series since <i>LOST</i>. That show broke me&mdash;ruined me, really, and made it impossible for me to trust that any TV series was anything more than promises of delayed gratification that would never actually pay off.
            </p>
            <p>
                But <i>Homeland</i> is clearly different. (Or, at least, the first season is.) Maybe it was the fact that I watched the majority of the season's twelve episodes while lying sick in bed, but I don't think I've ever seen a TV show with such well-motivated characters. Robert McKee says that <i>"The key to a great story is to give the audience what they want, but not how they expect it."</i> It's how a story can make the viewer feel smart but still delighted, and <i>Homeland</i> is so good at this. I see the writers setting up the characters in their correct positions, and the creepy music signals the oncoming conflict so clearly that I see each plot twist coming. But somehow, every single time, Homeland manages to surprise me. It's perfect.

                I love interviews, specifically interviews with "normal" people rather than "accomplished" ones. This series takes that idea and clothes it in claymation animals.

                The free version of this PS3 channel is like Sportcenter for the NBA, except instead of entertaining play-by-play commentary you get an extremely functional and well-designed interface for keeping track of the entire NBA. Three-minute summaries of <i>every</i> game are released once each game is completed, plus all the browsable stats, standings, and daily highlight reels you'd ever need. Just as with Sportscenter, I found myself wondering if watching the highlights might actually be better than watching the games themselves.

            <p>
                Vine is a lot of fun. Unlike videos on Instagram, Vine's videos loop seamlessly, and the length (6 seconds instead of 15) is restrictive enough to make you feel creative. The only unfortunate part, I think, is that no one is used to making videos of themselves and dealing with the resulting self-consciousness. Making obnoxious videos seems, for some reason, much easier than making an obnoxious photo. (Is it just the sounds of our voices? Maybe.) Anyway, I love Vine even if barely anyone I know (including myself) still uses it.

                I'd never cooked lamb before. Australians, thanks surely to the country's Greek influence, eat a lot of lamb, and so this curry reminded me a lot of something I might have eaten in Melbourne. But really, this is an amazing recipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also provided me with my first unquestionable example of something that is better the next day than it is the first: I've baked so many cookies that it's hard for me to understand how something could be better <i>not</i> fresh out of the oven, but this lamb curry definitely got better each time I had it. Like all curries, it's best served with brown rice and yogurt.

                Had I seen these videos when I was in middle school (i.e. when I was a big fan of screaming and trying to appear insane), Mike Patton would have been my idol and main source of inspiration. Before Mike Patton, I'd never seen anyone take a scream solo&mdash;let alone someone who treats screaming with such respect that he clearly sees it as a musical instrument, let alone someone who is such a musician at yells and shrieks that he is allowed to scream alongside respectable jazz musicians. Mike Patton's noises, even to my present-day self, are inspirational.

            <p>
                You might notice that I am avoiding talking about why I like the movies on this list. (See #2.) That's because, for whatever reason, I don't remember movies very well. If I don't write something down immediately after seeing one, all I'll remember in the long run is the magnitude of my enjoyment, which is convenient for things like ranking and knowing how much to nod and exclaim when someone else mentions the movie's name, but not for much else.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I do remember about <i>The Conversation</i> is that the protagonist is an amazingly written character. And that the only scene I didn't like was the nightmare/dream sequence. Sorry, that's all I got. But I did really enjoy it.

            <p>
               If you want to learn about braid theory, this is definitely the place to start. Braid theory is a branch of mathematics roughly concerned with the various ways of twisting around idealized threads (it's closely related to knot theory). Because braid theory is such a visual subject, normally you'd want a few pieces of string around if you started reading about it on your own. But making the sorts of braids necessary to understand the subject quickly gets too messy and complicated to do on your own, meaning Dalvit's virtual braids are the way to go. Her explanations are precise and well-paced enough for anyone (i.e. not just math-lovers) to follow along, and her voice is strangely peaceful.

                Tim and Eric disgust me whenever the camera involves the waist-down parts of their bodies. (Which, sadly, is most of the time.) But this youTube series, where Tim parodies TV cooking shows while also showing you how to make every ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard sauce imaginable, is brilliant.

        description: |
            <p>
                Google Hangout is like Skype with blurrier images and slightly-worse audio quality, but with the ability to video chat more than two people for free, and, most importantly, HATS.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first real experience with Google Hangout was last year when my Grandma (pictured above) turned 80 years old. My family threw her a surprise party that essentially doubled as a family reunion, and practically the only relatives <i>not</i> present were my cousin and myself, each of us half-way around the world both in time of day and location. So someone set up a laptop and let us "hang out". (The inclination to verbify "Hangout" and use it like "hang out" is both strong and obnoxious. I will resist this urge.)
            </p>
            <p>
                There's nothing <i>that</i> new about attending parties virtually. But Google Hangout lets you put on a virtual costume as well: You can put on a moustache, a dog mask, or you can make your background into clouds or a beach. But most importantly for birthday parties, you can wear a party hat. And there's nothing like the smile on a grandma's face when she's wearing a virtual birthday party hat.

                One of the most obnoxious things about using Python or Matlab is how messy things get once you start plotting things. Jupyter notebooks, like the IPython Notebook, let you display and edit narrative (Markdown), equations (latex), figures, and code all in one place.

                The NBViewer website can render any Notebook files found in GitHub repositories.

                Keepon's dance moves are inspirational. His creators' original aim was to see if they could get children to interact with him. I don't know if seeing him dance makes me want to dance <i>with</i> him, but it does make me want to dance very soon. If some day I have a room in my house filled with things like the dancing Keepon robot, I would be very happy.

                The Sky Guide app is like something out of a sci-fi movie&mdash;it's the astronomer's equivalent to a flying car, maybe. With the Sky Guide app, you hold the phone pointed towards the sky and look through it sort of like you would a telescope. Matching up the stars on its screen with the stars you see in the sky, you get a labelled map of stars, planets, constellations, and orbiting satellites.
            </p>
            <p>
            After only a few times using it, I started recognizing planets without needing the app. It's one of the rare times when technology seems to be bringing you closer to what's right in front of you rather than taking you farther away.

                I really like digital to-do lists. Their only problem is that, though they are pseudo-permanent and searchable, they tend to be unnecessarily bloated and ugly. And they don't let you export your own data.

            <p>
                However, Trello is not like this, meaning it is quite likely the greatest digital to-do list ever. Not only does it allow lists of lists, and lists of lists and lists, and checkboxes, and json exporting, but it also lets you make to-do lists with other people, and you can insert images and videos and comments and emojis, and...<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. It's also got a decent mobile app. I like it.

This is probably the greatest thing to ever happen to web development. Just a year ago or so, if you were a hobbyist web developer and you wanted to preview how your website appeared on a phone, this required <i>actually loading the webpage on your phone.</i> And all phones make the same website look different&mdash;thus the world of awful mobile webpages. But no longer! Now the only thing standing between us and a better mobile web experience is laziness. (See: this very website.)

                A dupe is chosen. The dupe is told to leave the room, and that while he is gone, someone will share a dream that they had recently so that everyone in the room except the dupe knows the full extent of the dream. When the dupe returns, he will ask everyone in the room as many yes/no questions necessary to try and learn as many details of the dream as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, however, there is no dream. The people in the room will answer all the dupe's questions randomly but consistently. The result is that the dupe will create an absurd dream narrative <i>all on his own</i>, often revealing to some extent his own fears, dreams, etc. My favorite way of ending the game is to ask the person "Do you know whose dream this was?" The (melodramatic) answer: "It's your dream. You just had it."

                First off, I love Snarkmarket for <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2014/8258">introducing</a> me to people like Satoshi Kon, who directed this movie. <i>Paprika</i> was Satoshi Kon's last movie. It is beautiful and overwhelming, the sort of movie that you remember even if you don't like it. The story and imagery seem to have been a major source of inspiration for Christopher Nolan's <i>Inception</i>.

                You know that strange feeling when you find yourself reminded that there are actual people sharing the Internet with you at all times? I'm thinking of moments like when Facebook first started showing you new "likes" without you having to refresh the page. Meatspaces is a chatroom with mandatory live GIFs of your face, and it evokes this feeling in a new way: "Wow! There are real people on the Internet. And they have <i>faces</i>."

                Shrub is a drinking vinegar. (I hadn't even known you could drink vinegar.) Adding vinegar to fruit was an old-fashioned way of preserving fruit for the off-season. Now, it's the kind of thing you keep in your fridge and add to a glass of ice and a bit of water when you need refreshment. Balsamic strawberry shrub is the best.

                Did you know that the most delicious <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce">pasta sauce</a> you can make requires only an onion, a can of whole tomatoes, and half a stick of butter? Or that chickpea soup could be delicious? That making carbonara is easy? I totally agree with the author of Marcella Hazan's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/marcella-hazan-changed-my-life">obituary</a> in The New Yorker: Marcella Hazan changed my life--she's teaching me how to cook.

                Live coding is improvised, interactive, and visualized programming. Using environments like <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>, you can perform music from your text editor. Repl Electric, to my ears, is not just the most successful live coding music group--it's the only successful one.

                The subtitle of this article is the perfect summary: "We’re not living in an algorithmic culture so much as a computational theocracy." This idea totally reconceptualized for me the role of programming and algorithms in our lives. To call something algorithmic isn't just wrong--it's "a theologized version of the diverse, varied array of people, processes, materials, and machines that really carry out the work we shorthand as 'technology.'" The products given to us by Google and Facebook, for example, are not made up of code: More so, they're made up of people.

You know how sometimes you find links to interesting looking articles, but you never read them? Before I'd either keep them open in tabs that I'd eventually close or else I'd bookmark them. Now, I just send the article to Pocket by clicking a button in my browser that sends them to my phone. And <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, an RSS reader, lets me manage all the blogs I want to keep up on. The problem is, now I always have something to do on my phone...

                Nearly every day for all of 2015 I've been taking short video clips and editing/compiling them using the 1SE ("1 Second Everyday") app on my phone. It's been an extremely satisfying way of summarizing my year; for instance, most of my October consisted of nothing but kittens and my girlfriend. Even better, the videos helped me self-monitor: If I ever noticed that the clips were getting monotonous (e.g., too many cats!), this was very tangible evidence for when I needed to try to shake things up and do something new.

                In my life, religious experiences come rarely (though they are usually caused by desserts). This pie blew my mind in a way I've never had it blown before. And it wasn't just me! Many other people at the event where this pie was served were equally and independently touched by the hand of God after eating it.

                I've never heard automated music so beautiful. What sets this project apart from other algorithmic music, I think, is its emotional appeal. While the correspondence between each note and a Wikipedia edit is immediately clear, somehow the precise logic of the music isn't at all important. Seeing and hearing Wikipedia edited in real time is a beautiful thing to witness, no matter how it's done.

                The best thing about this TV series has nothing to do with marijuana. Rather, the best thing about <i>High Maintenance</i> is the same thing that was initially so great about other series like <i>Girls</i> and <i>Portlandia</i>: it does an incredible job at portraying real-life, present-day characters that you've never seen captured in fiction before.

                I had no idea these things even existed, let alone that they would work so quickly and flawlessly, all in a device the size of a mini Altoids box. I don't think there are actually any great uses for these things yet, but there should be. All the same, watching your hand movement immediately transposed onto a computer screen is almost fascinating enough.

                <i>Ex Machina</i> was incredible--suspenseful, terrifying, thought-provoking...all of those great words. And yet, the more I thought about it, the more I <a href="http://blog.jehosafet.com/2015/04/ex-machinas-femme-fatale.html">realized</a> that "as thrilling as it is, Ex Machina is business-as-usual for literature and film." As an article in Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/ex-machina-turing-bechdel-test/">put it</a>: "Ex Machina has a serious fembot problem." All the same, though it's far from being a progressive feminist movie, it was easily the most interesting movie I saw all year.

                Aaron Swartz was involved in the development of RSS (at age 14!), Markdown, Creative Commons, and Reddit. He committed suicide at age 26 following an investigation into his attempts to download all of JSTOR. This documentary, about his short life and his dedication to things more important than money, made me cry, and it made me feel extremely angry at the world we apparently live in, and it showed me why so many people care so much about Aaron Swartz.
