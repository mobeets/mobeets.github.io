                <i>A pneumatic animatronic animal band plays all your favorite songs.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                But honestly, words are not at all needed to describe why this is one of my favorite things in the world. The band is so creepy and amazing that nothing I can say to you in this paragraph will capture that better than the videos themselves. This is my <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2013/8174">super bomb</a>, and my only real recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The band was created by Aaron Fechter (who is apparently the inventor of Whac-a-Mole) and is recognizable as the creepy robot animal band that plays at Chuck E. Cheese. Fechter started programming the Rock-afire to perform modern songs on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/therockafire/videos">his youTube channel</a>, and later attempted to keep the (brilliant, unbelievable, inspirational) project going by allowing users to <a href="http://www.starsof.com/fans/page5.html">bid on the songs</a> they wanted to see the Rock-afire perform. If you're looking for something equally disturbing but not quite as entertaining, I also suggest the educational <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7Lw4sYMAT4">videos</a> of his <a href="http://www.aaronskit.com/">Animatronic Experimenter's Kit</a>.

                Sergio Leone&mdash;I'm sure others can explain this better. Or you could just watch it if you haven't already. In my experience it was the kind of movie that only made me more curious as I read about it afterwards.

            <p>
                I have not sincerely committed myself to a TV series since <i>LOST</i>. That show broke me&mdash;ruined me, really, and made it impossible for me to trust that any TV series was anything more than promises of delayed gratification that would never actually pay off.
            </p>
            <p>
                But <i>Homeland</i> is clearly different. (Or, at least, the first season is.) Maybe it was the fact that I watched the majority of the season's twelve episodes while lying sick in bed, but I don't think I've ever seen a TV show with such well-motivated characters. Robert McKee says that <i>"The key to a great story is to give the audience what they want, but not how they expect it."</i> It's how a story can make the viewer feel smart but still delighted, and <i>Homeland</i> is so good at this. I see the writers setting up the characters in their correct positions, and the creepy music signals the oncoming conflict so clearly that I see each plot twist coming. But somehow, every single time, Homeland manages to surprise me. It's perfect.

                I love interviews, specifically interviews with "normal" people rather than "accomplished" ones. This series takes that idea and clothes it in claymation animals.

                The free version of this PS3 channel is like Sportcenter for the NBA, except instead of entertaining play-by-play commentary you get an extremely functional and well-designed interface for keeping track of the entire NBA. Three-minute summaries of <i>every</i> game are released once each game is completed, plus all the browsable stats, standings, and daily highlight reels you'd ever need. Just as with Sportscenter, I found myself wondering if watching the highlights might actually be better than watching the games themselves.

            <p>
                Vine is a lot of fun. Unlike videos on Instagram, Vine's videos loop seamlessly, and the length (6 seconds instead of 15) is restrictive enough to make you feel creative. The only unfortunate part, I think, is that no one is used to making videos of themselves and dealing with the resulting self-consciousness. Making obnoxious videos seems, for some reason, much easier than making an obnoxious photo. (Is it just the sounds of our voices? Maybe.) Anyway, I love Vine even if barely anyone I know (including myself) still uses it.

                I'd never cooked lamb before. Australians, thanks surely to the country's Greek influence, eat a lot of lamb, and so this curry reminded me a lot of something I might have eaten in Melbourne. But really, this is an amazing recipe.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also provided me with my first unquestionable example of something that is better the next day than it is the first: I've baked so many cookies that it's hard for me to understand how something could be better <i>not</i> fresh out of the oven, but this lamb curry definitely got better each time I had it. Like all curries, it's best served with brown rice and yogurt.

                Had I seen these videos when I was in middle school (i.e. when I was a big fan of screaming and trying to appear insane), Mike Patton would have been my idol and main source of inspiration. Before Mike Patton, I'd never seen anyone take a scream solo&mdash;let alone someone who treats screaming with such respect that he clearly sees it as a musical instrument, let alone someone who is such a musician at yells and shrieks that he is allowed to scream alongside respectable jazz musicians. Mike Patton's noises, even to my present-day self, are inspirational.

            <p>
                You might notice that I am avoiding talking about why I like the movies on this list. (See #2.) That's because, for whatever reason, I don't remember movies very well. If I don't write something down immediately after seeing one, all I'll remember in the long run is the magnitude of my enjoyment, which is convenient for things like ranking and knowing how much to nod and exclaim when someone else mentions the movie's name, but not for much else.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I do remember about <i>The Conversation</i> is that the protagonist is an amazingly written character. And that the only scene I didn't like was the nightmare/dream sequence. Sorry, that's all I got. But I did really enjoy it.

            <p>
               If you want to learn about braid theory, this is definitely the place to start. Braid theory is a branch of mathematics roughly concerned with the various ways of twisting around idealized threads (it's closely related to knot theory). Because braid theory is such a visual subject, normally you'd want a few pieces of string around if you started reading about it on your own. But making the sorts of braids necessary to understand the subject quickly gets too messy and complicated to do on your own, meaning Dalvit's virtual braids are the way to go. Her explanations are precise and well-paced enough for anyone (i.e. not just math-lovers) to follow along, and her voice is strangely peaceful.

                Tim and Eric disgust me whenever the camera involves the waist-down parts of their bodies. (Which, sadly, is most of the time.) But this youTube series, where Tim parodies TV cooking shows while also showing you how to make every ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard sauce imaginable, is brilliant.

        description: |
            <p>
                Google Hangout is like Skype with blurrier images and slightly-worse audio quality, but with the ability to video chat more than two people for free, and, most importantly, HATS.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first real experience with Google Hangout was last year when my Grandma (pictured above) turned 80 years old. My family threw her a surprise party that essentially doubled as a family reunion, and practically the only relatives <i>not</i> present were my cousin and myself, each of us half-way around the world both in time of day and location. So someone set up a laptop and let us "hang out". (The inclination to verbify "Hangout" and use it like "hang out" is both strong and obnoxious. I will resist this urge.)
            </p>
            <p>
                There's nothing <i>that</i> new about attending parties virtually. But Google Hangout lets you put on a virtual costume as well: You can put on a moustache, a dog mask, or you can make your background into clouds or a beach. But most importantly for birthday parties, you can wear a party hat. And there's nothing like the smile on a grandma's face when she's wearing a virtual birthday party hat.

                One of the most obnoxious things about using Python or Matlab is how messy things get once you start plotting things. Jupyter notebooks, like the IPython Notebook, let you display and edit narrative (Markdown), equations (latex), figures, and code all in one place.

                The NBViewer website can render any Notebook files found in GitHub repositories.

                Keepon's dance moves are inspirational. His creators' original aim was to see if they could get children to interact with him. I don't know if seeing him dance makes me want to dance <i>with</i> him, but it does make me want to dance very soon. If some day I have a room in my house filled with things like the dancing Keepon robot, I would be very happy.

                The Sky Guide app is like something out of a sci-fi movie&mdash;it's the astronomer's equivalent to a flying car, maybe. With the Sky Guide app, you hold the phone pointed towards the sky and look through it sort of like you would a telescope. Matching up the stars on its screen with the stars you see in the sky, you get a labelled map of stars, planets, constellations, and orbiting satellites.
            </p>
            <p>
            After only a few times using it, I started recognizing planets without needing the app. It's one of the rare times when technology seems to be bringing you closer to what's right in front of you rather than taking you farther away.

                I really like digital to-do lists. Their only problem is that, though they are pseudo-permanent and searchable, they tend to be unnecessarily bloated and ugly. And they don't let you export your own data.

            <p>
                However, Trello is not like this, meaning it is quite likely the greatest digital to-do list ever. Not only does it allow lists of lists, and lists of lists and lists, and checkboxes, and json exporting, but it also lets you make to-do lists with other people, and you can insert images and videos and comments and emojis, and...<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. It's also got a decent mobile app. I like it.

This is probably the greatest thing to ever happen to web development. Just a year ago or so, if you were a hobbyist web developer and you wanted to preview how your website appeared on a phone, this required <i>actually loading the webpage on your phone.</i> And all phones make the same website look different&mdash;thus the world of awful mobile webpages. But no longer! Now the only thing standing between us and a better mobile web experience is laziness. (See: this very website.)

                A dupe is chosen. The dupe is told to leave the room, and that while he is gone, someone will share a dream that they had recently so that everyone in the room except the dupe knows the full extent of the dream. When the dupe returns, he will ask everyone in the room as many yes/no questions necessary to try and learn as many details of the dream as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, however, there is no dream. The people in the room will answer all the dupe's questions randomly but consistently. The result is that the dupe will create an absurd dream narrative <i>all on his own</i>, often revealing to some extent his own fears, dreams, etc. My favorite way of ending the game is to ask the person "Do you know whose dream this was?" The (melodramatic) answer: "It's your dream. You just had it."

                First off, I love Snarkmarket for <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2014/8258">introducing</a> me to people like Satoshi Kon, who directed this movie. <i>Paprika</i> was Satoshi Kon's last movie. It is beautiful and overwhelming, the sort of movie that you remember even if you don't like it. The story and imagery seem to have been a major source of inspiration for Christopher Nolan's <i>Inception</i>.

                You know that strange feeling when you find yourself reminded that there are actual people sharing the Internet with you at all times? I'm thinking of moments like when Facebook first started showing you new "likes" without you having to refresh the page. Meatspaces is a chatroom with mandatory live GIFs of your face, and it evokes this feeling in a new way: "Wow! There are real people on the Internet. And they have <i>faces</i>."

                Shrub is a drinking vinegar. (I hadn't even known you could drink vinegar.) Adding vinegar to fruit was an old-fashioned way of preserving fruit for the off-season. Now, it's the kind of thing you keep in your fridge and add to a glass of ice and a bit of water when you need refreshment. Balsamic strawberry shrub is the best.

                The subtitle of this article is the perfect summary: "We’re not living in an algorithmic culture so much as a computational theocracy." This idea totally reconceptualized for me the role of programming and algorithms in our lives. To call something algorithmic isn't just wrong--it's "a theologized version of the diverse, varied array of people, processes, materials, and machines that really carry out the work we shorthand as 'technology.'" The products given to us by Google and Facebook, for example, are not made up of code: More so, they're made up of people.

                Nearly every day for all of 2015 I've been taking short video clips and editing/compiling them using the 1SE ("1 Second Everyday") app on my phone. It's been an extremely satisfying way of summarizing my year; for instance, most of my October consisted of nothing but kittens and my girlfriend. Even better, the videos helped me self-monitor: If I ever noticed that the clips were getting monotonous (e.g., too many cats!), this was very tangible evidence for when I needed to try to shake things up and do something new.

                I've never heard automated music so beautiful. What sets this project apart from other algorithmic music, I think, is its emotional appeal. While the correspondence between each note and a Wikipedia edit is immediately clear, somehow the precise logic of the music isn't at all important. Seeing and hearing Wikipedia edited in real time is a beautiful thing to witness, no matter how it's done.

As an article in Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/ex-machina-turing-bechdel-test/">put it</a>: "Ex Machina has a serious fembot problem." All the same, though it's far from being a progressive feminist movie, it was easily the most interesting movie I saw all year.

                Aaron Swartz was involved in the development of RSS (at age 14!), Markdown, Creative Commons, and Reddit. He committed suicide at age 26 following an investigation into his attempts to download all of JSTOR. This documentary, about his short life and his dedication to things more important than money, made me cry, and it made me feel extremely angry at the world we apparently live in, and it showed me why so many people care so much about Aaron Swartz.

Better yet, the design and controls on this thing are so elegant that it's basically like you have a DAW without ever needing to touch your computer. This is the first time for me that playing electronic music actually feels like playing an instrument.

                The Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh owns more than 20 electronic synths and pedals that you can check out and take home just like they were library books. Even better, the whole set-up has really reawakened my love for libraries. For example, I've started checking out books from the library instead of just buying them on Amazon.

                2017 was the year of the GAN, or generative adversarial network, a type of neural network. By far the most fun use of GANs is pix2pix, which can fill in your crappy line drawings and make them pseudo-realistic. More recently, GANs have been used to invent high-resolution images of <a href="http://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-10_Progressive-Growing-of">fake celebrities</a>. The downside is, as neural networks get better and better at faking images, it becomes less relevant to "only believe it when you see it."

                This video really blew me away. It sounds like a silly idea at first, but it quickly becomes a rollercoaster ride of terror and humor all mixed up together. The moment he gets in the balloon up to his neck was honestly one of the funniest things I think I've ever seen.

                This playlist by Tycho is great work music, but more important, it introduced me to such a wide variety of electronic music that I'd never even heard of before--especially Weval, which became one of my favorite albums this year.

In this game, you and your friends have to fill various orders in a restaurant, all while dealing with obstacles such as awkward kitchen designs and earthquakes. Even more fun, you can play while sharing only one or two controllers.

                I really grew to love this show. The character development is so gradual and methodical, I really got into it. The seasons unfold really naturally so that different characters become the protagonists in different seasons, so that at one point or another you've seen the world from everyone's perspective. Plus, the focus of the show is computers and technology, and it's a lot of fun to watch the focus shift from mainframes in the 70s, to video games in the 80s, and the Internet in the 90s.

                Quanta is by far the most consistently good science writing I've come across. In my opinion, this is because the writers at Quanta understand that almost all research questions--and I don't mean the overly simplified versions!--are accessible to outsiders, once you get past the jargon. Even better, Quanta articles do a really good job of conveying the researchers' excitement for what they're doing. A good example of this is their coverage of the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/2018-fields-medal-and-nevanlinna-prize-winners/">2018 Fields Medalists</a>.

                I've always been bad at Nintendo games, partly because I grew up with a Playstation, so it felt good to finally master a version of <i>Mario Kart</i>. This version is all over the place, visually, but it also comes with the equivalent of a bowling lane's bumpers, so you don't have to constantly fall off the roads if you don't want to. Which makes it a great video game to play with other people who are also bad at video games.

            <p>
                <i>Deconstructed</i> interviews producers and beat-makers about how they made the music to various songs. What was surprising to me was how you can end up contributing a beat to a J Cole or Kendrick Lamar song, but that doesn't lead to fame, fortune, or even necessarily a friendship with the artist. It's also interesting to see the different DAWs being used: lots of Fruityloops and Ableton, but those are by no means the only ones being used. One of my favorites in the series is on Childish Gambino's "Redbone". Another thing worth mentioning is the <a href="http://songexploder.net/">Song Exploder</a> podcast, though the focus there is more on the musicians than on the producers.

                People in academia love to poke fun at twitter as a waste of time, as if all anyone's doing is mindlessly retweeting links to papers. Even if that were the case (which it's not), isn't that still more useful than a journal's email digests? The fact is, twitter is full of people using tweets to provide a unique kind of research synopsis that you simply cannot find in any other medium, including talks, poster sessions, or abstracts. Even better, it's a new way to promote science and reach new audiences. Without the #tweeprint, and science-twitter in general, I would know absolutely nothing about the mechanosensory system of <a href="https://twitter.com/NatashaMhatre/status/1074739264879874048">black-widow spiders</a>.

One of the videos I return to all the time is this set by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqu5NdFMf8">Floating Points</a>.

                I first came across this visualization in a <a href="https://twitter.com/jhnhw/status/1031829726757900288">tweet</a>, and it just immediately blew my mind. How could numbers look so much like...a solar system? Even weirder, it's not even apparent on closer look why these numbers group up like they do and form such distinct looking types of clusters. No one's convinced there's necessarily something new in this view from a mathematical perspective, but still, I find it inspiring.

                The Carnegie Mellon laser cutters have been kind of like a library for me, in that it took some time to figure out exactly how I wanted to use it, but once I did I wondered how I did without it. Making things with it is a slow process filled with trial-and-error, but it's also very magical. As my instructor put it, "Never forget the power of this machine: it can take sketches or drawings that you've made and turn them into <i>real objects</i>."

                I can't imagine the pressure Nintendo must have felt to put out this game, knowing that practically everyone buying the Switch was waiting for it to come out. That's what makes it even more impressive that this game is so well done! The fact that they included 70+ characters was initially overwhelming, but it's actually what makes this game so easy to keep playing; there are always more characters to discover. As a testament to how much I love this game, Jess and I played it 101 days out of the first year we owned it.

                I love this song, but the music video just really takes it over the top. The video is a sort of kaleidoscope composed of thousands of images of city-scapes such as apartment windows and highway overpasses, and the effect is mesmerizing. It's kind of like <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>, but entertaining. Part of me wants to understand exactly how these visuals were made. Is there any sort of pattern matching done automatically by software, or is it all done manually? Either way, I'm sure something like this takes a lot of work. The result is beautiful.

                I hope that subconsciously, whenever I imagine the process of life beginning from a single fertilized egg, I will picture scenes from this short film. (The fact that the end result here is a tadpole doesn't really matter.) Early in the video (e.g., at 0:30), it's almost as if the cells are dividing and then twisting to make room for the others in unison. How is this possible?? I would love to watch an annotated version of this video.

                This website is a sort of experimental tutorial about quantum computing with its own built-in study app. The study app is based on the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_learning">spaced learning</a>, where the goal is to learn new concepts with the minimum amount of studying, by studying things at just the right time. While I didn't stick with the tutorial for very long, I think it's a really cool concept&mdash;as well as a very clever way of encouraging your audience to keep returning to your website!

                This has probably been the first youtube channel where I've consistently watched their videos basically as soon as they came out, one per week. Each video explains different aspects of microscopic life, featuring creatures such as tardigrades, rotifers, and ciliates. It's beautiful microscope footage (though I never even knew such a thing existed before this channel) with nice ethereal music. It was the perfect thing to put on when the boys were little and I had nothing else to do.

                For a while, one of my favorite things to do to relax was to put on some nice HD underwater footage on youtube on mute while listening to ambient music such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjnAE5go9dI"><i>The Distintegration Loops</i></a>, Jan Jelinek, or Cluster & Eno. It's amazing how much high-quality amateur underwater footage there is! The cool thing is that there are always animals and fish that I've never seen before. Clearly there are way more weird sea creatures than I knew.

                This paper, titled "The intrinsic attractor manifold and population dynamics of a canonical cognitive circuit across waking and sleep," introduced me to an interesting data analysis technique I'd never heard of before called persistent homology. But method aside, it had never occurred to me that different data types (e.g., continuous vs. discrete, linear vs. circular) actually mean the data lives on a particular topological space. For example, the space formed by two circular variables is a torus, or donut, while the space formed by two continuous variables is a plane. Even if the data analysis part is sensitive to noise or computationally intractable, I think it's a really cool perspective to keep in mind (for example, it can explain why neural activity in motor cortex is <a href="https://mobeets.github.io/psth-to-population/">shaped like a cone</a>).

                I thought this was a really interesting point: If someone asks you which planet is closer to Earth <i>right now</i>, then on average you'd always be better off guessing Mercury than Venus. In fact, the Earth is closer on average to the sun than it is to any planet, and the explanation is purely mathematical and very simple. Reading the comments, I think many people thought this point was annoying or pedantic, but I thought it was initially pretty surprising.

This made the whole experience even better--kind of like seeing an amazing movie without having ever seen the previews. For $33 a person (and BYOB), I and three others were treated to a private, seven-course dinner of Hungarian food, hosted by an incredibly lovely man named Alex. It's a very unique eating experience, and one that I will likely never forget!

                I've been looking for an app like this for a long time. It's like Spotify for plants! The AR thing works really well: You just point your camera at a plant, and try out different angles until the app recognizes it. This app transformed our morning walks for at least a month, as we tried to learn the names of every weed and wildflower we came across. Two downsides: 1) It doesn't identify trees very well. 2) It should let you save photos of the same species in different seasons, since the same plant can look very different before/after it's flowered (for example). Still, this app is amazing, and I recommend it to practically anyone I take a walk with.

                I spent February and March of this year learning Blender, arguably the most powerful free software application out there. It's for 3D modeling, which means you can use it for everything from making 3D animations, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYuUlQO-kYE">3D sculpting</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjnyapZ_P-g">creating CGI worlds</a> for use in film. It's a truly amazing piece of software, and it totally transformed the way I watched movies and (especially) animation. Ian Hubert's talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whPWKecazgM">world building</a> is an incredible introduction to some of the things Blender can do, and Blender Guru's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD">donut tutorial</a> is excellent.

                This recipe is so random and awfully presented, and yet so fundamental in our house.

The critical ingredient: coconut oil. The missing ingredient: eggs.

It's essentially an interview podcast, with intricate/trippy animated eye candy (from Pendleton Ward, of <i>Adventure Time</i>) to watch as you listen to the host, Duncan Trussell, interview his guests about life, death, spirituality, meditation, and drugs. Every episode is interesting, but the series finale, in which Duncan interviews his mother, is genuinely one of the most moving things I've ever watched/listened to. It will stick with you.

                Geology is probably the one subject I regret not having taken in college. It's a really difficult area to learn on your own! Still, this year I found two very useful resources. First, the book that sparked it all was John McPhee's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19894"><i>Basin and Range</i></a>, where I learned about the <a href="https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Education_Careers/Geologic_Time_Scale/GSA/timescale/home.aspx">geologic timescale</a>. Amazingly, if you scale the Earth's five billion year history <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_Calendar">to a single calendar year</a>, dinosaurs don't show up until December 13, and all of recorded human history takes place in the last ninety seconds of the year. My second resource was Nick Zentner's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi1oj2WDhNE&t=3694s">Geology 101</a> videos (played at 2x speed), from which I learned about basic rock types, and absolute/relative age dating.

                During the pandemic it felt like we tried every video conferencing app that existed: Zoom, Facetime, Marco Polo, Houseparty...But my favorite, by far, was Gather. The unique part about Gather is that it offers a sense of space. In Gather, you control an avatar that you can move (with your arrow keys) through a Gameboy-like world, and you can only talk to someone when your avatar is near their avatar. This gives you the ability to freely move in and out of conversations with people&mdash;rather than having to see/talk to everyone simultaneously, as you do in every other conferencing app. My introduction to Gather was the New Year's Party we went to last year. It was almost like a real party, and at the time, that was mindblowing.
