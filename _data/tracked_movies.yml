    description: agree with the review that says "visually stunning, but totally unintelligible".
        very much like Upstream Color to me, where there's really no way to understand
        anything. except this movie is just so void of clues, even, that understanding
        the story doesn't really seem to be even suggested

        is the one thing _not_ lost in translation, unlike every other interaction
        they have with the movie with other people. They become close because they
        just _do_ so much together, just having fun, no talking, and that needs no
        translating.
