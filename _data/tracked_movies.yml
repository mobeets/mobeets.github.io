    description: Jess likes it better than The Good, The Bad...! I thought this one
        was more hoakey, Jess thought it less; either way, it was great and not at
        all long. The intro was awesome, with the sounds, and I loved Cheyenne. Also
        I still want so badly to someday build my own (log) house.

        title refers to Will's (and the red-haired madam's, and Little Bill's) belief
        that humanity is unforgiven by God, i.e. we've all sinned, we're all going
        to hell, and there's no "deserve" because life is not rational and bad shit

        feminine problem-solving approaches and pros/cons; alcoholism being "the white
        man''s burden"; studying the development of madness in a statistical way,
        if that even makes sense, would be cool; studying it in any way would probably
        be cool; knowing madmen, or anyone with a brain disease really, would probably
        make all brain disease the biggest real impulse for studying the brain. Who

    description: agree with the review that says "visually stunning, but totally unintelligible".
        very much like Upstream Color to me, where there's really no way to understand
        anything. except this movie is just so void of clues, even, that understanding
        the story doesn't really seem to be even suggested

    description: great--I love both of them, and it ends so happily. their relationship
        is the one thing _not_ lost in translation, unlike every other interaction
        they have with the movie with other people. They become close because they
        just _do_ so much together, just having fun, no talking, and that needs no
        translating.
