    content: Unless you've seen a truffle shaved in front of you into your food, anything
        you've eaten that has "truffle" in the name likely does not contain the real deal.
        Instead, it's synthetic truffle flavor extracted from petroleum (!); any truffle
        bits you see are likely "decorative" truffles---cheaper, flavorless species
        of truffles.

        will make it swing higher. Whereas pushing too frequently wastes energy.
